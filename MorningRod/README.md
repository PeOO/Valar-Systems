<h1>The MorningRod</h1>

The MorningRod is a first-of-its-kind IoT smart curtain rod that helps you wake up feeling refreshed. 

It uses one NEMA 17 motor, Trinamic driver, and ESP32 to move your curtains whenever you'd like. 

Use the MorningRod app and schedule your open times, or modify the Arduino code to do whatever you'd like.
