## 1. VALAR W1: Smart Window Opener

Download the design files [here.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0048/6244/3590/files/Model_W.rar?v=1611853391)

Unzip the folder.

You will find two folders named "Left" and "Right". For windows that **OPEN TO** the left, use the "Left" folder. For windows that open **OPEN TO** the right, use the "Right Folder".

that contains all of the parts individually, as well as all of them placed on one platter. 

Everything on the platter is placed in the correct orientation.

There’s always a change for failure when printing so many parts together, so I recommend that you print the 3 larger flat pieces separately. This also keeps them from warping as much.

The easiest thing to do is open up the platter and delete the parts you don’t want. This way they all stay in the correct orientation.

A few other notes:

-No supports
-0.2mm layer height
-PETG filament.
