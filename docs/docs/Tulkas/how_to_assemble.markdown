<p>If you purchased the MorningRod Self-3D printed kit, you will need to print your own parts and assemble them.</p>
<p>This guide will show you how to do that. </p>
<p>Step 1: Print 3D printed parts located on the <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3889979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thingiverse page.</a></p>
<p>Depending on the version you are creating, there are two sets of files</p>
<p>Version 1) MorningRod</p>
<p>Version 2) MorningRod 2020</p>
<p>The original MorningRod uses custom made aluminum extrusions. If you purchased these from us, use Version 1.</p>
<p>If you purchased the 2020 Version, which uses off-the-shelf 8020 extrusions, use Version 2.</p>
<h2>Printing Parts</h2>
<p>The STL files are organized in two ways. One folder contains platters, and the other contains individual pieces. </p>
<p>The platters are designed in PrusaSlicer and printed on a Prusa MK3S. The platter might be too large to work with your printer. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0048/6244/3590/files/Platter_480x480.jpg?v=1570762175" alt="" width="480x480" height="480x480" /></p>

<p>This will require you to delete parts from the platter to make it smaller. </p>
<p>You can also print individual parts as well from the Individual folder.</p>
<h3>3D Printer Settings</h3>
<p>All parts must be printed with PETG to make them stronger. You can try to use PLA, but it may break so be careful.</p>
<p>Layer height is 0.20mm</p>
<p>Total print time is about 25 hours.</p>
