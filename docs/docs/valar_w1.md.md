## 1. Download the App

The Android or iOS app is required. Please download using the links below

[For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.blynk.appexport.morning_rod)
[For iOS](https://apps.apple.com/al/app/morningrod/id1455653248)

Before mounting any hardware, we need to test the connection and the device.

Open up the app, create an account, and log in.

## 2. Reset the WiFi

During manufacturing, WiFi credentials may have been stored in your device. You need to clear them out before you can connect.

If you have an "Open Left" window opener, the clear WiFi button is located here:

If you have an "Open Right" window opener, the clear WiFi button is located here:

Hold the button for **15 seconds** until the LED light begins flashing quickly 

The credintials are now cleared and we can connect to it.

**WARNING: Only 2.4Ghz networks will work. Your phone must be connected to a 2.4Ghz network for this to work**

### 3a. Initial Test

Before attaching the device to a window, we need to test the motor. 

To select a device, find it on the main page and **long press it**, holding it for 2 seconds

![WIFI add device 2](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0048/6244/3590/files/Settings_Window_3.jpg?v=1610131256)

Select the settings tab

Be sure "DANGER: 1 CLOSE" is selected. We will learn more about this later

Select "FAST/LOUD" so it moves faster

**WARNING: Damage may occur if the magnets fell out during shipment. Ensure BOTH magnets are still in the carriage**

**NOTE: If the carriage does not stop on either end and damage begins, unplug immediately**



Use the purple buttons to move the opener to set it up.
    1) "ADJUST" will open the window 1 inch, this helps when setting up the magnet
    2) "CLOSE" will close to the end
    3) "OPEN" will open towards the motor housing

Test out OPEN and CLOSE, ensure the carriage stops on its own on both ends

## 4. Attach to the Window

We will go over attaching the window opener to your window and sill.

Pay very close attention to these, otherwise damage may occur if installed poorly.
