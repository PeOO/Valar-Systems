## 1. Download the App

The Android or iOS app is required. Please download using the links below

[For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.blynk.appexport.morning_rod)

[For iOS](https://apps.apple.com/al/app/morningrod/id1455653248)

Before mounting any hardware, we need to test the connection and the device.

Open up the app, create an account, and log in.

## 2. Reset the WiFi

During manufacturing, WiFi credentials may have been stored in your device. You need to clear them out before you can connect.

Locate the WiFi rest button near the power plug. There are 2 buttons, so be sure to press the correct one.

The WiFi button is **opposite** of the USB plug.

Press and hold the button for **15 seconds** until the LED light begins flashing quickly 

The credentials are now cleared and we can connect to it.

## 3. Test The Motor

Before hanging anything up, we need to be sure everything is working correctly.
