## 1. Download the App

The Android or iOS app is required. Please download using the links below

Before mounting any hardware, we need to test the connection and the device.

Open up the app, create an account, and log in.





## 2. Reset the WiFi

During manufacturing, WiFi credentials may have been stored in your device. You need to clear them out before you can connect.

Locate the WiFi rest button near the power plug. There are 2 buttons, so be sure to press the correct one.

The WiFi button is **opposite** of the USB plug.
