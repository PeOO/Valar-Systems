## 1. Download the App

The Android or iOS app is required. Please download using the links below

[For Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.blynk.appexport.morning_rod)

[For iOS](https://apps.apple.com/al/app/morningrod/id1455653248)

Before mounting any hardware, we need to test the connection and the device.

Open up the app, create an account, and log in.

## 2. Reset the WiFi

During manufacturing, WiFi credentials may have been stored in your device. You need to clear them out before you can connect.

If you have an "Open Left" window opener, the clear WiFi button is located here:

If you have an "Open Right" window opener, the clear WiFi button is located here:

Hold the button for **15 seconds** until the LED light begins flashing quickly 

The credentials are now cleared and we can connect to it.
